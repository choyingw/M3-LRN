**Advantages:**

\+ **State-of-the-art on all 3D facial alignment, face orientation estimation, and 3D face modeling.**

\+ **Exploitation of Multi-Modal and Multi-Representation for information aggregation.**

\+ **Fast and easy to use: 3000fps for 3D facial landmarks on a single GPU.**

\+ **The first to study the face reconstrcutability from sparse landmarks.**
